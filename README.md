# FriendFinder_HW11
Building a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys,  and then compares their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.  Express is used to handle routing. The app is deployed to Heroku so other users can fill it out.
